# Introduction to Neural Networks
Consider leaving a ‚≠ê if you like this series of tutorials.

This repo gets you started with Deep Learning the hard way, that is using only the basic maths libraris to code the models. Then it introduces you to TensorFlow. This will be all about about coding Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms. There are different Jupyter Notebooks that you can go through.
